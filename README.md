This is a *tiny* Chrome extension that keeps track of the NYC rental listings that you've
already seen on StreetEasy and fades them slightly so that you don't need to keep wondering
if they're worth looking at.

To set up:

1. Clone this repository,
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`,
3. Make sure that the "Developer mode" checkbox is checked,
4. Click "Load unpacked extension...", and point to where you cloned the repo.

This saves the listings that you've seen using the Chrome "Storage" API.
